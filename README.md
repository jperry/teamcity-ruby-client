Ruby wrapper for the TeamCity Rest API

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'teamcity-ruby-client'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install teamcity-ruby-client

## API Usage Examples

* Tested on TeamCity 7.X and 8.X
* Most of the api calls return either an array of Hashie::Mash objects or a single Hashie::Mash object which allows you to send messages to retreive an attribute easily.
* See [api docs](http://rubydoc.info/gems/teamcity-ruby-client/TeamCity/Client) or [specs](spec/teamcity/client) for additional examples and usage

### Configuration

* See [configuration](lib/teamcity/configuration.rb) source or api doc for more configuration options
* You may use v7 of the TeamCity api by adding '7.0' to the endpoint configuration (This would be similar to using latest on a TeamCity 7 server)

```ruby
require 'teamcity'

# This only needs to be set once per Ruby execution.
# You may use guestAuth instead of httpAuth and omit the use of http_user and http_password
# This is using the latest version of the api
TeamCity.configure do |config|
  config.endpoint = 'http://my-teamcity-server:8111/httpAuth/app/rest'
  config.http_user = 'teamcity-user'
  config.http_password = 'teamcity-password'
end
```

### Projects

```ruby
# Get a list of projects
puts TeamCity.projects

# Get a project by id
puts TeamCity.project(id: 'project1')

# Get a list of buildtypes for a project
puts TeamCity.project_buildtypes(id: 'project1')

# Each item returned is a Hashie::Mash object which allows you to send messages
# to retreive an attribute easily.  For example, get the name of
# the first buildtype in a project
puts TeamCity.project_buildtypes(id: 'project1').first.name

# Create an empty project
TeamCity.create_project('my-new-project')

# Copy a project
TeamCity.copy_project('project1', 'copied-project-name')

# Delete a project
TeamCity.delete_project('project1')

# Change project name
TeamCity.set_project_field('project1', 'name', 'new-project-name')
```

### Build Types (Build Configurations)

```ruby
# Get a list of buildtypes (build configurations)
puts TeamCity.buildtypes

# Get buildtype details (build configuration)
puts TeamCity.buildtype(id: 'bt1')

# Get buildtype steps
puts TeamCity.buildtype_steps(id: 'bt1')

# Change buildtype name
TeamCity.set_buildtype_field('bt1', 'name', 'new-buildtype-name')
```

### Builds ###

```ruby
# Get build details
puts TeamCity.build(id: 1)

# Get build tags
puts TeamCity.build_tags(id: 1)

# Fetch all the builds (defaults to the last 100 builds, use the 'count' build locator to return more)
puts TeamCity.builds

# Filter builds by multiple criteria's using the build locator
puts TeamCity.builds(count: 1, status: 'SUCCESS') # This will return the most recent build that passed

puts TeamCity.builds(count: 1).first.name

puts TeamCity.builds(buildType: 'bt3') # Fetch all builds where buildType=bt4

puts TeamCity.builds(status: 'FAILURE') # Fetch all builds that failed

# Passing the output to another to fetch additional information
puts TeamCity.build(id: TeamCity.builds(count: 1).first.id).buildType.name # Fetch the name of the last build to run

```

### VCS Roots ###

```ruby
# Get all the vcs roots
puts Teamcity.vcs_roots

# Get vcs root details
puts TeamCity.vcs_root_details(1)

# Create VCS Root for a project
TeamCity.create_vcs_root(vcs_name: 'my-git-vcs-root', vcs_type: 'git', :project_id => 'project2') do |properties|
  properties['branch'] = 'master'
  properties['url'] = 'git@github.com:jperry/teamcity-ruby-client.git'
  properties['authMethod'] = 'PRIVATE_KEY_DEFAULT'
  properties['ignoreKnownHosts'] = true
end

```
